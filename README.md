# S4N Technical test
In this repo, I'm going to develop a technical challenge provided by S4N.

## Language, tools and libraries
This project was developed using the following:
* **Java** as programming language
* **Maven** as build and dependency manager
* **Lombok** in order to avoid boilerplate code
* **Junit 5** as a testing library

## Branch strategy
I used branch-by-feature in order to simplify the branch strategy and avoid creating unnecessary branches.

## Business conditions
* There are 20 drones available
* The drones must operate simultaneously
* The coverage area is 10 streets around
* Every dron can delivery 3 lunches per day.
* The delivery routes will be set in a file, every dron has its own file with name in01.txt, in02.txt 
and so on.
